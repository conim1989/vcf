# Files Modified During VCF Processing Fix

## Modified Files:
1. **vcf_extractor.py** - Enhanced VCF reading and contact extraction
2. **app.py** - Added working directory fix and debug logging

## New Files Created:
1. **build_improved.spec** - Enhanced PyInstaller spec
2. **test_vcf_processing.py** - Test script
3. **build_fixed_exe.py** - Build script
4. **exe_fix.py** - Working directory fix
5. **VCF_PROCESSING_FIXES.md** - Documentation

## To Restore Original Files:

### Option 1: Git (if you have version control)
```bash
git checkout HEAD -- vcf_extractor.py app.py
```

### Option 2: Manual Restoration
The main changes were:
- **vcf_extractor.py**: Enhanced `_read_vcf()` and `_extract_contact_data()` methods
- **app.py**: Added working directory fix at the beginning

### Option 3: Keep Working Version
Since the test script shows VCF processing works correctly, you might want to:
1. Build the exe with current fixes
2. Test if VCF processing works in the exe
3. Only restore if needed

## Critical Fix Applied:
The main fix was adding this to the beginning of app.py:
```python
# CRITICAL FIX: Set working directory to exe location
if getattr(sys, 'frozen', False):
    exe_dir = os.path.dirname(sys.executable)
    os.chdir(exe_dir)
```

This ensures the exe runs from the correct directory for file operations.
